Residential and commercial review appraisal services. Our firm provides highly experienced geographically located residential and commercial review appraisers&nbsp;throughout California for technical compliance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). Many technical appraisal issues confront banks and lenders today and require the skill of a highly experienced residential or commercial review appraiser. For example, if zoning issues are not properly addressed in an appraisal, it can affect the outcome of the highest and best use of the subject property and therefore the&nbsp;selection of the comparable sales. As a result, if the&nbsp;comparable sales utilized in the report do not have a similar highest and best use, the opinion of market value of the subject property may not be credible.&nbsp;
Defining the appraisal process. The home &amp; commercial appraisal process starts with the definition of the problem by&nbsp;California appraisers. One of the first steps in the residential or commercial appraisal process is the identification of the client, the intended use and users, and the purpose of the appraisal. Then the&nbsp;commercial appraiser would want to know the property characteristics including its location and property rights including leased fee, leasehold, or fee simple. In addition, any extraordinary assumptions and or hypothetical conditions would further define the appraisal problem. Many times this will be enough information to indicate the type of commercial appraisal report option&nbsp;California appraisers can use.
After the commercial appraisal problem has been defined the residential or commercial appraiser can then determine a cursory scope of work and quote a fee. After the client accepts the fee and the type of report option the commercial appraisal process can then proceed to the next step.
In order to describe the scope of work in a home or commercial appraisal assignment, the California appraiser must first identify any extraordinary assumptions and or hypothetical conditions. Extraordinary assumptions presume uncertain information to be factual. If found to be false, could alter the California appraisers opinion of value.  Hypothetical conditions are contrary to what exists, but the conditions are asserted by commercial appraisers for purposes of analysis.
The next step is defining the scope of work. This would be the amount of work and specific type of information and data researched and the type of analysis and methodologies applied in a home or commercial appraisal. The scope of work should indicate what was done and what was not done. Following this step the California appraiser would gather all the data.
