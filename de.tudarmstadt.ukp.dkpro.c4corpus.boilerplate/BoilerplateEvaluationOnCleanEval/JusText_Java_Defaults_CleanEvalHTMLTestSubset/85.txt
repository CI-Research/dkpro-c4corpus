The following applications are supported by the various divisions of Information Technology @ Johns Hopkins.  Please note that access to some of these applications is restricted to computers on the Johns Hopkins network and are not accessible off site.
Allscripts &nbsp; Allscripts is a medication management solution enabling physicians to create electronic prescriptions.&nbsp; The system provides physicians with important information at the point of prescribing, including formulary management, drug utilization reviews and other key indicators.&nbsp; Allscripts provides an automated physician charge entry tool which is used to capture charges at the point of care.
  Applicant Tracking System Tracks demographics and status of job applicants BDM Pharmacy&nbsp;&nbsp;JHH&nbsp;The RxTFC system support the&nbsp; Inpatient and Outpatient Clinic areas supported by the five JHH Pharmacy satellites. The Investigational Drug Department uses the system to track certain studies. The software manages 10,000 daily doses and billing between $100-200,000/day. The Pharmacy staff of 180 has been trained in the application according to usage needs.
Big Brother Big Brother is a Web-based Systems and Network monitor. It consists of simple shell scripts which periodically monitor system conditions and network connectivity, Disk space, CPU, servers, and important processes&nbsp; can be tracked.&nbsp;
Clinical Systems Security Provides access to the Electronic Patient Record based on the user’s clinical status.
Content Management System (CMS) Enables multiple content creators within the organization to post their information quickly and directly to the Web, while maintaining consistent branding through customizable page templates.
Cost Allocation System Cost Allocates cost where it is incurred.
  Data Warehouse
Decision Support System (DSS) Depository of patient data from EMTEK bedside units, used for research by the SICU staff.
Document Management System Capture paper and/or electronic documents that need to be accessed by the front-end and the back-end.
Electronic Patient Record  ( EPR) JHH&nbsp;Allows clinicians to access documents describing a patient’s stay in the Hospital (i.e. Discharge Summaries, Operative Notes, Clinic Documents).&nbsp; It allows the physician to finalize (i.e. “sign”) a document.&nbsp; It allows for a clinician to navigate through the various result reporting (Lab and Rad) systems and to get a listing of patients, either through a floor census or through a list associates with the physician.&nbsp; This system is available to both JHH and to JH-Bayview, with specific coding for each institution. EPR Web allows access to EPR via the Web.
Executive Information System (TSI ) Cost accounting and decision support system that provides flexible budgeting, departmental performance, outcome management and contract analysis.&nbsp; Currently used by JHH and BMC.
HDM – HIS System provides ability to add procedure and diagnosis codes to patient records, transfers records to billing system.

Hospital Accounts Payable (AP ) Centralized system for all payments for JHH and&nbsp; JHHS
Interface Engine A complex messaging standard, HL7, for the exchange of information between systems (patient admitted, lab result, radiology result, diet order ...).&nbsp; An interface engine is a sort of router - applications which have something to say send messages to the interface engine, it checks to see which other systems have "subscribed" to that specific content type of the message, and forwards a copy of the message to them.&nbsp; In the real world, different vendor's systems rarely agree on all aspects of the message formatting, so another major function of the interface engine is to reformat messages as needed for each recipient.&nbsp; Our HL7 interface engine environment spans JHH and JHBMC, includes at least 60 clinical and administrative systems, and delivers about 3,000,000 messages a week.
JHSecure (VPN) JHSecure is a flexible IPSec based remote access Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution, which allows members of the Hopkins communities to access computer resources located at Hopkins from remote locations.
