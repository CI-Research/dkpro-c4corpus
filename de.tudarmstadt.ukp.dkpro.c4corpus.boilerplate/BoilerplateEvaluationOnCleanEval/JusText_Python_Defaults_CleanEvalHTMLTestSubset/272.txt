<h> Introduction
<p> Who
are Australians? Where have they come from? In which ways do we perceive
our 'Australianess'? Would we all answer these questions in the same way?

<p> The
Question
<p> The
main question you will be asked to find an answer for is:
<p> What
does it mean to be Australian?
<h> Background
Information
<p> Have
you already completed the Subject
Sampler and the Knowledge Hunt?
If not, you should do both of these now to get some background on Oz and
its people. You could also check out some of these links:
<h> Individual
Tasks
<p> Now
that you have some overall background knowledge, it's time to return to
the main question for this WebQuest. A questions this big and important
is better answered when a few people are working on it at one time. Things
work even better when a group of you decide to look at the question from
different perspectives. This way team members can become experts on different
aspects of the question and then come together to poll their learning.
This is where team work pays off. So are you ready to divide and conquer
this question?
<p> Group
members must then re-form to answer the essential question: WHAT
DOES IT MEAN TO BE AUSTRALIAN?
<p> Each
group will present their thesis in the form of an oral presentation.
All six members must speak to the question for a period of no less than
3 minutes per speaker. The team's oral presentation should be structured
with an introduction, middle and conclusion (want
help?) (which includes an answer to the question).
<p> VIETNAMESEUse
the links below to find out more about the Vietnamese in Australia.
Think about how a Vietnamese-Australian may experience his/her 'Australianess'
different to you. Specifically, look for answers to the following
questions:
<p> What is the dominant religious
belief of the Vietnamese? In what ways might religious belief affect
the way the Vietnamese live their life? Vietnamese
Religions and Beliefs
<p> Read this personal story.
Why did this 18 year old leave Vietnam? Was his life endangered during
his journey? In what ways might this experience affect a Vietnamese
refugee trying to settle in Australia? Personal
Story
<p> A Vietnamese, recently arrived
in Australia, many face many challenges. Belief systems vary and
language barriers exist. Imagine you are a Vietnamese person with
a health problem and you have to visit an Australian doctor. How
can 'language differences' and 'belief systems' affect your visit?
Vietnamese
Cultural/Practical Experience
<p> Read Mr
Phi Lu's story. Why did he leave Vietnam? What hardships
did he face on his journey? How long did it take to finally arrive
in Australia? Think of 3 descriptive words to sum up how Mr Lu felt
when he first sighted Australian soil.
<p> Scroll down to the heading
'Settlers Born in Viet Nam and Hong Kong' to find out when
the Vietnamese arrived. Read further to find out why there was
a sudden influx of immigrants.
<p> Rumbaut claims that 'In the
case of the Vietnamese, differing life experiences of the children growing
up in the U.S. and their immigrant parents can turn the generational gap
into a chasm' What are some of the conditions which create this 'chasm'?
The
Biculturation of the Vietnamese Student
<p> 'Second
generation' means that at least one parent was not born in Australia
and the 'second generation' (children) were born in Australia. What
percentage of second generation Greeks speak Greek in their home?
Why do you think so many second generation Greeks speaks Greek in their
homes? Australian
Social Trends
<p> Are
second generation Greeks likely to marry other Greeks? What is the
long-term affect of this trend? Australian
Social Trends
<p> Although
this article is humorous, it gives a good insight into how 'wogs' see themselves.

<p> ABORIGINES
<p> Use
the links below to learn more about aborigines in Australia.
Specifically, look for answers to the following questions:
<p> Read
this page, focussing on the fundamental differences and misunderstandings
between Aborigines and white settlers. How many of these differences
still exist? Aborigines:
The First Australians
<p> Look
at the comparisons which are made in this article between aboriginal people
and the rest of the Australian population. What are your personal
suggestions for how these statistics can be overturned? Hutchenson
Encyclopaedia
<p> According
to the author of this site, Ian Coller, aborigines have suffered a loss
of 'a common humanity'. Read the whole page. How do you think
that affects the way aboriginal people experience their 'Australianess'?

and Australian Aborigines
<p> New
Zealand has a diverse population, similar to Australia's. True or
False? About NZ
People
<p> Clearly,
the All Blacks are a significant part of New Zealand culture. The
question is: Do you think it is justified for New Zealanders who
live in Australia to still support the All Blacks? Why/Why not?

Synthesis
<p> Congratulations!
Each person on your team has become an expert on one group of Australians.
<p> Guess
what, gathering useful information isn't the same as truly understanding
a topic. What experts in the field of learning suggest is that you now
use that information in a new and challenging way. Then you'll really know
about this topic.
<p> So
with you team members all gathered together, carefully read and try answering
the main question for this WebQuest. See where you all agree and where
differences arise. Use information,
pictures, movies, facts, opinions, etc you explored to convince your teammates
that your viewpoint is important and should be part of your team's answer
to the question. Your WebQuest team should arrive at an answer that
everyone on the team can live with.
<p> Before
your group presents its findings, ask yourselves these questions:
<p> Have
we worked co-operatively as a group?
<p> Are
we prepared to give our answer? (practise!)
<p> Is our
presentation structured?
<p> Do we
need to prepare any resources?
<p> Are
our speaking roles evenly distributed?
<p> Is the
correct question being addressed?
<p> What
have we learnt?
<p> Your
group can now present its thesis in the form of an oral presentation.
All six members must speak to the question for a period of no less than
3 minutes per speaker. The team's oral presentation should be structured
with an introduction, middle and conclusion (which includes an answer to
the question).
<p> Real
World Feedback
<p> Research
contacts you can make for each of the six ethnic groups and write a letter
to each of them asking for an answer to the question: What
Does it Mean to be Australian? Compare/contrast your conclusions
with the replies.
<p> Conclusion
<p> At
the beginning of this activity, you were asked about the truth. Did you
discover it? Was there only one? Did everyone on your team think so? How
did you answer the main question for this WebQuest?
<p> You
deserve a lot of praise for all the work you've done. And so does your
brain. You've sure put that gray stuff to the test. You gained background
information, developed expertise in one particular area and got into some
pretty expert analysis. At times, you must have felt confused with ideas
spinning every which way. That's normal when you're building new mental
connections. It's funny, with each link between what you already knew and
the new learning going on, you broke another different kind of link, remember
the intellectual slavery we spoke about earlier? You're free! How will
you use these ideas and strategies as you continue to grow and learn? It's
all up to you. Good luck.
