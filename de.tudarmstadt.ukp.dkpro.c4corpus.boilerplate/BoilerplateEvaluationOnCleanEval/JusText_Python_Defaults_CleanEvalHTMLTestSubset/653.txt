<p> Squirrel CountingAdd fun to your early childhood
counting curriculum with this preschool activity by Jana M.
<p> Materials: Small dixie cups
, squirrel pattern and nuts.
<p> Description: Teachers take
a squirrel pattern and staple it to dixie cups. Write a number on each
squirrel. Now, have the child count out how many nuts they need
for that squirrel. Have a different number on each squirrel. You
can also have the child take nuts away from the squirrel, to see how many
he has left.
<p> Comments: Some three's
I find are not quite ready for this. I find that by the end of the year
they're doing it much better.Take a look at

<p> Year
'Round "Seasonal Tree"Share the ideas of the changing season with
children just as Terry H. does.
<p> Description: We place a large brown tree
with bare limbs on a vacant wall. We begin the school year
with green leaves on this tree. Teachers can put children's name on individual
leaves. The children enjoy seeing their names placed around the room. I
generally put flowers at the base of the tree and a sunshine could be put
up over the tree.
<p> FALL:
Gradually start changing the green leaves to fall colored leaves. Once they have all changed, have them begin
to "fall to the ground" untilthe tree is bare. We make pumpkins
to put under the tree to replace the flowers and at halloween time add
faces to these pumpkins.
<p> WINTER:
Explaining the seasons to the children, we tell them aboutsummer and fall. Since our tree is
now without leaves, during the winterwe will add our own "special" things to
the tree. We make:
<p> Snowmen in DecemberMittens in JanuaryHearts in FebruaryEaster Eggs in March.
<p> Then the leaves begin to reappear for the spring.
<p> New for this year, we're adding apple blossoms
(made from tissue paper) to the tree in September and then change those
blossoms to apples. Showing it as a fall apple tree (before we do
the color change on the leaves).
<p> Comments: This was a new idea for last year.
We are going to use it thisyear to really discuss the changing seasons
and also incorporate ourapple lessons.
<p> Away up high in an apple tree.Point
up.Two red apples smiled at meForm
circles with fingers.I shook that tree as hard as I couldPretend
to shake a tree.Down came those apples.And mmmmmmm, were they good!Rub
tummy.
<p> Description: After going on a nature hike
for the above materials, cut a wreath shape out of cardboard. Ask
children to decorate their wreath with their own findings. You may
want to have them put ribbon on it too.
<p> Comments: This wreath looks so nice when
done that it can be keptall year round.Take a look at

<p> Color Song: Leaves on the TreesDuring this Autumn activity
preschool children stand in a circle, sing this song and perform actions
to the tune of "The Wheels on The Bus".
<p> The leaves on the
trees come tumbling down,Tumbling down, tumbling down.(Children
flutter their hands and fingers down to the floor each time the phrase
'tumbling down' is repeated)
<p> The leaves on the trees come tumbling
down,All over town.(Children
flutter hands down, then turn around)
<p> The leaves on the trees are red
red red,Red red red, red red red,(Everyone
wearing red clothes goes to the middle of the circle and shakes themselves)
<p> The leaves on the trees are red
red red,All over town.
<p> The leaves on the trees
are green green green,Green green green, green
green green.(Everyone
wearing green goes to the middle of the circle and shakes)
<p> The leaves on the trees are green
green green,All over town.Repeat for orange
and yellow leaves
<p> You will need:Enough large paper bags for
half the children in your group, tape, glue/glue stick, craft paper and
a felt tip marker
<p> In advance explain to preschool children
that they will collect fallen leaves. Remind children not to put
leaves off plants, bushes or trees. Only collect the leaves that
have fallen on the ground. Encourage young children to use the "buddy
system" when collecting (two preschoolers share each collection paper bag).
As the children collect leaves teachers use descriptive words, "I see you've
found 3 orange leaves" etc.
<p> Back inside the preschool classroom, during
small group time, sort the leaves according to color, size or kind.
Together with young children count how many of each color, size or kind.
Are there more brown leaves than green leaves?
<p> Creating a vertical bar graph will
help children compare the leaves according to a classification category
such as color etc. On craft paper teachers list the leaf colors.
Next ask children to tape or glue leaves in the appropriate color column.
Display on children's eye level and refer to the bar graph often during
the fall season.
