1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and even angina.&nbsp; Physical exam findings include pallor, tachycardia, and jaundice.
 
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To generate a differential diagnosis anemia, first categorize the type of anemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic) by MCV and furthermore with the ferritin and reticulocyte count.&nbsp; Then, exam the peripheral smear: findings on the smear will narrow your differential, suggest additional medical problems the patient may have ( i.e. target cells and liver disease, spur cells and uremia with uremic platelet dysfunction), and may reveal diagnoses such as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in a timely fashion.&nbsp; Finally, order additional tests to confirm your diagnosis and remember to get your tests before transfusing the patient.
 
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factoids:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitalized patients will drop their hematocrit 1% per day from blood draws.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Epogen� causes hypertension if the hematocrit is raised &gt; 35% in ESRD and does not work in the setting of iron deficiency.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the hemoglobin and not the hematocrit. The hematocrit is calculated from two measured values and has a � 3 point range for error.
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iron deficiency: On physical exam, look for koilonychia, atrophic tongue.&nbsp; Iron deficiency usually does not cause a microcytic anemia until the hematocrit drops below 30%.&nbsp; Ferritin is useful for diagnosing iron deficiency. The likelihood ratios are as follows: for a ferritin &lt;15 the LR=50 in favor of iron deficiency anemia; for a ferritin &lt;25 the LR=10, specificity of 98%; for a ferritin &gt;100 the LR=0.1. Since ferritin is an acute phase reactant, some say it should not be used in the setting of inflammation; others say that in chronic inflammation a ferritin &lt; 50 is highly suggestive of iron deficiency.&nbsp; Iron is low and transferrin or TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is high, which makes the transferrin saturation (iron divided by transferrin) low: a saturation &lt;10% has a specificity of 88%. The RDW (reflecting anisocytosis) is high. Once you�ve made the diagnosis, rule out GI bleeding: around 60% of patients will have GI lesions. Order stool guiaics, a colonoscopy, and possibly an EGD.&nbsp; With treatment, the hematocrit should be normal in 2 months; continue iron treatment 4-6 months to replete stores. Common side effect of oral iron is constipation.&nbsp; IV iron available if patient refractory to PO, but has increased risk of anaphylaxis. Each PRBC transfused contains 200 mg elemental iron.
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thalassemia: The Mentzer index may be helpful: (MCV/RBC count) &lt; 13 favors thalassemia over iron deficiency.&nbsp; This test has a high sensitivity but low specificity.&nbsp; Basically in iron deficiency, the marrow can�t produce RBCs and they�re small so the RBC count will be low along with the MCV.&nbsp; In thalassemia, RBC production is preserved, though the cells are small and fragile.&nbsp; So the RBC count is normal with a low MCV.&nbsp; This concept may be more helpful than remembering the Mentzer index.&nbsp; The RDW in thalassemia, unlike iron deficiency, is normal and may be a more accurate discriminant function in differentiating between the two.&nbsp; Make the diagnosis of beta-thalassemia with hemoglobin electrophoresis. Alpha-thalassemia will not show up on electrophoresis: it is diagnosed by molecular diagnostic techniques. Order an �A-thal� on the lab slip. Think of A lpha thalassemia in A sians.&nbsp; Beta thal in Meditteraneans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Differential diagnosis for target cells on smear: beta thalassemia, hemoglobin C disease, liver disease, beta-lipoproteinemia.&nbsp; In general you should not see targets in sickle cell unless they are sickle-thalassemia or sickle-C.
 
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anemia of chronic disease: Chronic inflammatory diseases, that is, such as cancer and collagen-vascular diseases. Transferrin is decreased, saturation increased, iron low, ferritin normally increased (non specific for chronic disease). The MCV rarely falls below 78, though the patient can become microcytic because they are functionally deficient of iron.
Now correct for early release of reticulocytes by dividing by (1 + 0.5 x ) where x is 1 for every drop of 10% in the hematocrit.&nbsp; For example, divide by 1.5 for HCT=35% and divide by 2 for HCT=25%.
You now have the reticulocyte index (RI).  If the RI < 2 for HCT 10-35%, or < 3 for HCT < 10%, your patient has a hypoproliferative anemia.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mixed: e.g. an alcoholic with megaloblastic anemia from folate deficiency, and iron deficiency from GI bleeding. The MCV is normal, but the RDW is increased reflecting anisocytosis (cells of varying sizes).
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send LDH, total and direct bilirubin, and possibly haptoglobin (level &lt; 25 is 96% specific for hemolysis).&nbsp; A normal LDH and haptoglobin &gt; 25 helped rule out hemolysis in one small study.&nbsp; Haptoglobin overall is not very useful as it takes one week to return, is an acute phase reactant, and is very sensitive (leading to decreased specificity).
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enzyme:&nbsp; e.g. G6PD deficiency: normal smear and Coomb�s. Check G6PD levels, which may be normal after an acute hemolytic episode or post transfusion. Consider this in HIV patients, particularly African Americans, taking PCP prophylaxis. Although this is X-linked recessive, it may still occur in females due to lyonization.
 
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Megaloblastic : hypersegmented neutrophils (&gt; 5% of neutrophils with 5 lobes or &gt; 1% with 6 lobes) are seen on the smear. An MCV &gt; 120 is almost pathognomonic for megaloblastic anemia. Ovalocytes may be seen, but are nonspecific. On physical exam, look for atrophic tongue.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: repletion of vitamin B12 should always accompany folate and iron therapy until you are sure the patient does not have multiple deficiencies, in order to avoid aplastic-type crisis and/or high output CHF.&nbsp; In addition, folate may partially correct the megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency while the neurologic symptoms progress.
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 9 in 10 pulmonary emboli originate from DVTs, and the treatment of PE and DVT are usually identical.
 
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DVTs are associated with calf pain and tenderness. Homan�s sign�pain when dorsiflexing the foot with the knee extended�is neither sensitive nor specific and should be abandoned.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the patient one (1) point for each of the following (if they are present): active cancer, immobilization, bedridden &gt; than 3 days due to surgery, localized tenderness, entire leg swelling, asymmetric &gt; 3 cm calf swelling,&nbsp; pitting edema, or collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose).
Is there an alternative diagnosis that is as likely or more likely than DVT?  If yes, subtract 2 points.
Score > 3: high probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 75% .
Score 1-2: moderate probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 17% .
Score 0: low probability of DVT, prevalence of 3% .
 
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work-up of suspected DVT:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D-dimers : very useful if your local hospital has the ELISA test which is very sensitive (good for ruling out DVT).&nbsp; Some labs use the latex agglutination test, which is only 85-90% sensitive. Thus, in a patient with a non-diagnostic V/Q scan (for PE) or Doppler ultrasound (for DVT), a negative D-dimer (ELISA method) means it is probably safe not to anticoagulate if your clinical suspicion is low or moderate.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doppler ultrasound : This test is better at detecting DVTs above the knee (which, in fact, are the clinically significant ones as clots below the knee rarely cause pulmonary embolism).&nbsp; Ultrasound is 50% sensitive in an asymptomatic individual, and therefore cannot be used to rule out PE. Ultrasound is also less sensitive than venogram for calf DVT.
 
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hypercoagulability work-up:
After the first event, the hypercoaguable work-up will lead to an etiology in only 30% of patients; after the second DVT only 50% will eventually have an etiology determined.  Moreover, only 10-20% of people with an idiopathic DVT will ever have another event.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not necessary to begin the work up of anticoagulation at the time of the clot: the results won�t change your management and will take a while to come back anyway; therefore, consider an outpatient work-up.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw an extra blue top tube before starting heparin or warfarin if you suspect a hypercoaguable state: heparin will interfere with assays for antithrombin III and the lupus anticoagulant.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protein C, S, anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine, prothrombin 20210A, Factor V Leiden, and MTHFR mutations (leading to hyperhomocysteinemia) can be sent when patients are taking heparin.&nbsp; Note that Proteins C and S are vitamin K dependent factors and will be lowered by warfarin therapy.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AT III, Protein C, and Protein S may be transiently depressed during the acute event, and only persistent lupus anticoagulants are associated with hypercoagulability. Therefore, repeat abnormal tests later to make an accurate diagnosis.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that there is not a consensus that all patients with unprovoked DVT/PE should have a hypercoagulability work-up.&nbsp; The most common defects are not associated with recurrent disease, and the ones that are, are uncommon.&nbsp; A targeted work-up is likely a more reasonable approach ( e.g. send antiphospholipid antibody as persistent lupus anticoagulant is associated with venous/arterial recurrence and may require a higher INR goal for warfarin therapy).
 
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treatment : typically involves heparin (or enoxaparin) and warfarin.&nbsp; Some advocate giving patients heparin for 5 days, even if their INR becomes therapeutic in less than 5 days. Patients should be therapeutically anticoagulated as soon as possible (within 24 hours). Thus, it is better to overshoot and risk bleeding than to undershoot and risk further embolic/thrombotic events.&nbsp; See Hematology/Oncology: Heparin and Hematology/Oncology: Warfarin (below).
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When to use low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin): LMWH eliminates the need to monitor PTT and adjust dosages. You may send selected patients home with enoxaparin and warfarin, rather than keeping them in-house on heparin for 5 days or until they are therapeutic on warfarin (see Hematology/Oncology: Outpatient therapy for venous thromboembolism ).&nbsp; Moreover, LMWH is associated with a lower incidence of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia.&nbsp; Regular, ultrafractionated heparin is preferable when:
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the warfarin on day one of heparin or enoxaparin if long-term anticoagulation is desired.&nbsp; Usually 5.0-7.5 mg PO at night (to ensure absorption on an empty stomach) on Day 1, then 2.5-7.5 mg PO QHS (most often 5 mg). Increase in the INR of &gt; 0.3-0.4 units per day should result in a dose reduction (otherwise an INR overshoot is likely).
 
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goal for INR:
An INR of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical prosthetic valves or recurrent systemic thromboembolism
INR of 2.0-3.0 for most others (uncomplicated DVT/PE).
 
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information about the patient's past warfarin dosing history will help you titrate appropriately. Congestive heart failure, liver disease, vitamin K deficiency and certain medications influence warfarin response. Tailor the duration of warfarin therapy to the individual and the indication � usually three months to life.
5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bebulin is a plasma-derived concentrate of factors II, VII, IX, and X.&nbsp; It should be used in life threatening bleeds associated with warfarin.&nbsp; Dose Bebulin ~50 U/kg IV push (need to give concomitant vitamin K).
 
6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For heparin associated bleeding:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfractionated heparin: Protamine 1 mg for every 100 units heparin given. Dose by adding the amount given during each prior hour divided by 2 number of hours back .&nbsp; For example, a patient on a heparin drip at 500 units/hour for 3 hours (without a bolus) would have approximately (500/2 0 )+(500/2 1 )+(500/2 2 ) =&nbsp; 500 + (500/2) + (500/4) = 875 units of circulating heparin.&nbsp; Therfore, the patient should be given 8-9 mg of protamine.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most plasma removed. One unit should raise the hematocrit by 3 points or hemoglobin by 1 g/dL.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leuko-poor/leuko-filtered red blood cells have most WBCs removed to make it less antigenic. Use in patients prone to transfusion reactions and in patients requiring multiple transfusions (bone marrow transplant, leukemia, chemotherapy).
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washed red blood cells have WBC almost all removed. Use as for leuko-poor RBC; note that they are more expensive.&nbsp; Used for patients with allergic reaction to transfusions.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross-matched platelets may be used when patient has been sensitized to random-donor platelets and no longer bumps their platelet counts after transfusion; cross-matching typically takes at least 1-2 days as well as lab medicine approval at most institutions.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always check a 1 hour post-transfusion platelet count to ensure a response and to monitor for alloimmunization.
 
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh frozen plasma (FFP):
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A high PT is frequently encountered in end-stage liver disease. It is generally okay to leave a high PT alone when a patient is not bleeding. For those with refractory bleeding, use an FFP drip�the half-life of FFP is about 4-6 hours.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FFP is indicated if the PT &gt; 18 seconds and is associated with bleeding or planned procedures.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use is generally reserved for patients with quantitative fibrinogen deficiency ( e.g. DIC) and qualitative fibrinogen deficits ( e.g. acquired dysfibrinogenemia associated with liver disease). Its use in patients with hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and von Willebrand disease has been supplanted by the use of specific factor products that are safer and more efficacious.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advantage: you can replete with less volume than FFP.
 
1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work-up: for all transfusion reactions consider a workup for a hemolytic reaction: blood cultures and hemolysis labs, including purple top for Coombs and red top for repeat type and cross.&nbsp; The blood bank is required to investigate and will help. The different types of reactions are listed below.
 
2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preexisting anti-RBC antibodies in the recipient hemolyze donated blood. Usually caused by ABO incompatibility due to a clerical error. Fever and hypotension occur early in the transfusion; chills, flank pain, and dyspnea may occur.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extravascular immune-mediated process mediated by noncomplement-binding IgG. Ideally, the �screen� portion of the type and screen will identified patients susceptible to this complication.&nbsp; Fever, jaundice, and anemia occur 2 days to 2 weeks after transfusion.
 
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anaphylaxis:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is different from an acute hemolytic reaction.&nbsp; Interestingly, the reaction is not IgE mediated, but caused by immune-complex activation of complement � by �anaphylatoxins.�&nbsp; Symptoms are anaphylactoid, occur early in transfusion, and include laryngeal edema.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look for endotoxemia�the onset of high fever/shock within 4 hours of transfusion. Platelets are far more likely to be contaminated with bacteria than blood, because they are stored are room temperature.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is characterized by fever &gt; 1 � C during or within 2 hours of completing transfusion. It occurs with 1 in 5 platelet transfusion reactions and is of limited clinical significance. It is questionable whether it is necessary to discontinue the transfusion. Caused by antibodies against foreign donor leukocyte antigens.
 
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urticarial reaction:
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some say it is okay to continue transfusion if the patient responds to antihistamines. Again, this is different from�and does not progress to�an anaphylactiod reaction.
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-cover documented Pseudomonas by adding an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin. The fluoroquinolone is preferable given the renal toxicity of aminoglycosides.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most hospitals that have a bone marrow transplant unit have an antibiotic algorithm that you should follow when treating bone marrow transplant patients with neutropenic fever.
� &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The patients most likely to suffer from full blown sepsis syndrome are those who are penicillin-allergic.
 
 
SICKLE CELL PAIN CRISIS
 
Your hospital staff typically know these patients well.  Often, the patient�s primary physician has contracted with the patient for an individualized pain protocol.  Consider consultation with the hematologist or pain service to get the exact details (if they exist).  Don�t be surprised by massive opiate tolerance and the need to rapidly escalate the analgesia dose required for relief: remember, physicians typically under-treat pain.  Unlike most opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, codeine and hydrocodone have ceilings beyond which increasing doses will not result in increasing analgesia.
In the past, the dogma for treating sickle cell crises called for aggressive fluids, oxygen, and even bicarbonate infusions as methods to reverse the �sickling� process in the red blood cells.  However, we have since learned that the event that led to the sickle crisis (and thus the �sickling�) has already occurred by the time the patient comes into the ER.  Therefore, these measures are unlikely to be helpful and may be harmful (see below).
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to determine precipitating factor(s): stress, dehydration, drug use, infection, hypoxia, MI, etc. Although, remember that many of these patients come in and out of the hospital for "routine" pain crises without specific precipitants. While pain crises often present with non-specific elevations in WBC and low-grade fevers, there always is the potential for something bad to be going on. Therefore complete work up of concomitant infection is important.
 
4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute chest syndrome: This is one of the dreaded complications of sickle cell disease and a leading cause of death in adults with this disease.&nbsp; You should think of this diagnosis in any patient with cough, chest pain, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and/or new infiltrate on CXR who has a history of sickle cell disease.&nbsp; Etiology is not fully known, but thought to involve micro/macro vascular infarction, pulmonary fat emboli, and concurrent viral/bacterial infection.&nbsp; Management primarily consists of supportive care, bronchodilators, treatment of coexisting infection, and transfusions if needed.&nbsp; In addition, a simple transfusion may be adequate, but if the patient�s clinical situation worsens an exchange transfusion may be needed.
3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cerebral metastases: can present as headache, seizures, altered mental status, or focal deficit.&nbsp; Common in breast and lung cancer.&nbsp; Diagnose with head CT.&nbsp; Treat with dexamethasone, radiation, and possible surgery.&nbsp; With edema, mass effect, and/or midline shift, consider measures to control the rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) such as mannitol and hyperventilation.
7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tumor lysis syndrome: findings include � potassium, � phosphorous, � uric acid, � creatinine, and � calcium.&nbsp; Often occurs with tumors that are bulky and very chemotherapy-sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seen often in Burkitt�s lymphoma.&nbsp; Prevent with hydration and allopurinol.&nbsp; If patient develops syndrome, treat electrolyte abnormalities and continue hydration and allopurinol.
 
8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperviscosity: patients present with nonspecific CNS symptoms such as headache, dizziness, somnolence, and blurry vision.&nbsp; More often occurs in patient with myeloma, Waldenstrom�s macroglobulinemia, and polycythemia vera.&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtain CSF, head CT to rule out other CNS processes. Treat with hydration, phlebotomy (for polycythemia vera), and chemotherapy.
 
9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leukostasis: occurs with very high white blood cell count in acute leukemias.&nbsp; Symptoms include hypoxia, renal insufficiency, altered mental status, and somnolence. Can worsen during induction chemotherapy.&nbsp; Obtain CSF and head CT to rule out other diagnoses.&nbsp; Treat with leukopheresis, hydration, induction chemotherapy, and possibly hydroxyurea.&nbsp; Avoid blood product transfusions as this might worsen symptoms.&nbsp; Wait until after you white blood cells have been removed by leukopheresis.
 
10. &nbsp; DIC: often occurs in patients with AML (especially M 3 variant) and adenocarcinoma patients.&nbsp; Diagnose by PT/PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count, and D-dimers.&nbsp; Treat by correcting deficits�platelet transfusions, FFP, vitamin K, cryoprecipitate.&nbsp; Treat the underlying cause.&nbsp; Heparin is occasionally used to suppress the consumptive process, but the data on this is limited.
