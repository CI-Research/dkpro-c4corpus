Glass (b. 1937), along with Steve Reich, LaÂ Monte Young, and Terry Riley, helped shape the minimalist movement. His highly recognizable style has won Glass wide critical and commercial acceptance. Glass's music is marked by its repetitions and bright keyboard figures, and he has made important inroads into scoring music for films and unconventional operas. Here are his essential recordings.
Although Einstein on the Beach is by definition an opera, Philip Glass's most famous work also transcends traditional music categories. Glass avoided all vestiges of plot in the piece and dug deep into his quiver of repetitions to create an artfully unnerving five hours of brilliance. The instrumental ensemble never exceeds five members, playing electric keyboards, saxophones, flutes, and a single violin.

His masterpiece in this repetitious and rigorously structural composition style-- Music in Twelve Parts --may be just too much for some people to take. If so, then this disc may be just the ticket. Of course, Glass's many fans will snap it up as a matter of course, but as the title implies, there's somewhat more happening here than in his very first minimalist works--just enough so that newcomers to the style...

Glassworks remains Philip Glass's bestseller from the middle period of his career, the recording by means of which many listeners familiarized themselves with his music. Conceived as a thematically whole instrumental studio album taking advantage of the promotional and marketing capabilities of what was then Glass's new major label (CBS, now Sony Classical) and targeted at consumers intrigued with his newfound notoriety, Glassworks features six parts (three per side on the original LP and...
