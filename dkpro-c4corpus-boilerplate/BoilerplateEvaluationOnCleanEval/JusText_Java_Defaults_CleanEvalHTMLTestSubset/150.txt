Web Services, people, software providers, writers and resources who have made this weblog more useful. A long overdue category... plus resources to never track of... First things first: this is not for "public consumption" this feed is raw, unedited bits of news gathered from the Web, direct quotes from savy bloggers. This is not meant as a weblog... noooo.... this is my personal treasure chest of knowledge... That said, I'm NOT WRITING it. got it? It's not for review or anything else... I'm hoarding it to a space on the web where I can go back and find it. Why, you say? : stupid computer, stupid browser, stupid bookmarks can't track this stuff like a Radioland feed can ... and having it on the web is so useful.
