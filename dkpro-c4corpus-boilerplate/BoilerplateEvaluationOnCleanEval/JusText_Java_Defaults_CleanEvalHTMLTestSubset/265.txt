Ordered nachos as starters which they forgot to bring until the main course. Fajitas were only average. I was expecting them to arrive sizzling hot but they weren't so the food was only lukewarm.
What did you drink?
Bottle of house white at about �13 was okay.
What's the crowd like?
Arrived about 7pm on a Monday night so had a choice of tables. Got quite full later on.
And the vibe?
Nice building but tables were a bit cramped and the chairs uncomfortable. The couple at the next table started smoking so it was time to skip dessert and coffee and leave.
Anything else you'd like to say?
Overall disappointing. Seem to be trading on reputation alone. There are plenty of better options in York.
Value for money?
�53 for 3 mains and wine. They didn't charge for the starters.

Where is it?
York
What's the number?
No need! They don't take bookings!
What's the grub like, then?
If I was being generous I'd say it was fair. However, if I was more honest, I'd say overrated. But my problem wasn't with the food.
What did you drink?
Bottled beer and house wine. Slightly pricey, but tasted nice.
What's the crowd like?
Couples of all ages.
And the vibe?
Crowded and smokey upstairs
Anything else you'd like to say?
Was told you can�t book, so turned up without a reservation and had to wait two hours for a table. When we were finally seated, we noticed many tables were unused. Upstairs the bar was packed full of people waiting for tables and downstairs there were LOTS of tables unused? I got the feeling they were just ushering customers upstairs for an hour or two to get a few extra rounds of drinks out of them. Very annoying! Not in a rush to return!
Value for money?
I paid �8 for a plate of nachos chips with a couple of dollops of salsa for a starter.

What's the grub like, then?
Plunketts is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first visited years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas time) on our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The food is always excellent and the steaks are cooked just how you order them. I can also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'! This time round we tried the Christmas cake and Godminster for dessert, and for a strictly Cheddar-only man like me this was a real treat - Fantastic! However having since purchased some of the aforementioned cheese I have been disappointed not to be able to achieve the same kick.
What did you drink?
Black Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition as admiring the view through the bedsit window across the street from upstairs, or banging my head on the low beams.
What's the crowd like?
Sadly the clientele appear to be getting younger; I say 'appear' because I am a realist and suspect that age wise I now have more in common with the fabric of the building than some of the punters!
And the vibe?
Soapbox time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm and ambience, on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by the fug of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and to have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled) by something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those who enjoy it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand on the great debate then!
Anything else you'd like to say?
If you should visit in the week before Christmas be sure to have a seat next to the roaring fire! Only my wife likes to sit next to the window in the bar to see the Minster - so do I, of course!
Value for money?
Always! We shared the dessert and still couldn't manage it!

What's the grub like, then?
Fanastic. Wide choice and variety. Took a long time to decide what to order!
What did you drink?
House white, very nice.
What's the crowd like?
We booked for mid afternoon so quiet. A few couples, work parties.
And the vibe?
Trendy, I could go with a partner or friends. I think it has the right setting to make the atmosphere what you want. Lots of pictures of famous stars everywhere, great.
Anything else you'd like to say?
Will definately be going again. Staff were friendly and the food exceptional.
Value for money?
For 7; 3 courses and drinks it came to �180 which was good value for money. Each course was a generous portion only just had enough room for desert.
