Publication 1001, page 8, on the Gain on sale of personal residence bullet:
For sale or exchanges after 5/6/97, federal law allows an exclusion of gain on the sale of a personal residence in the amount of $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly). The taxpayer must have owned and occupied the residence as a principal residence for at least 2 of the 5 years before the sale. California conforms to this provision. However, California taxpayers who served in the Peace Corps during the 5 year period ending on the date of the sale may reduce the 2 year period by the period of service, not to exceed 18 months.
If there is a difference between the amounts excluded (or depreciated, if recapture applies) for federal and California, complete California Schedule D (540 or 540NR). Transfer the amount from California Schedule D, line 12a, to Schedule CA (540 or 540NR), line 13, column B (if gain is less than federal). Transfer the amount from California Schedule D, line 12b, to Schedule CA (540 or 540NR), line 13, column C (if gain is more than federal).
