As a sex expert (Ph.D. in Human Sexuality, M.P.H. in Human Sexuality), an author ("Different Loving","Come Hither", others), a sex-and-relationships expert (Cosmo, Maxim, GQ, Redbook, dozens of others), I have accumulated thousands of insights into what makes people tick sexually. I've worked with hundreds of individuals on sex and relationships, first as a peer counselor and, since 2000, as a licensed clinical sexologist (member, American College of Sexologists). As a journalist and author specializing in sex and relationships, I've also fielded thousands of sex questions over the years.
From all that I've learned, I believe that personal happiness cannot come until an individual is at peace with his or her sexual identity. In my practice, I help clients to accept their own sexual truths and teach them to make the best possible life choices for themselves based on what they learn about themselves.
Whether you need help building relationship skills, overcoming inhibitions, dealing with a sexless marriage; are coping with impotence, premature ejaculation, inability to orgasm, obsessions/addictions, medical issues or STDS; or have questions or concerns about gender issues, BDSM, fetishism, bisexuality, swinging, or other unusual sexual flavors, I will work with you to make positive choices.
I pride myself in being different from other therapists in several ways. I don't think it's enough to be a good clinician: without empathy and a personal investment in the client's success, therapy can drag on indefinitely without results. My goal is to make myself unnecessary to clients - to help them get to a place where they don't need to speak to me every week to keep their lives in balance. I am an advocate for my clients' personal goals. I do not waste time and money on silence. I offer advice, insights, and share my own experiences when relevant. I view the therapy process as an opportunity for a client to reveal him or herself completely to someone who has both the skill and the commitment to identify problem areas, ask the hard questions, get to underlying truths, and to provide support and comfort when clients feel vulnerable.
My approach to human sexuality is enlightened, upbeat, and completely nonjudgmental. I blend therapeutic methodologies to tailor each course of therapy to the individual(s). I work hard to help you help you forge tangible positive changes in your life and to heal from the past. I am incredibly proud of the progress that my clients make. Nearly every client who has committed to a course of therapy with me has achieved the goals they set and, more often, exceeded them. I love "graduating" clients.
My practice is restricted to adults, age 18 and over. Couples of all varieties are welcome.
As both a licensed clinical sexologist and a long-time kinky person, I offer uniquely supportive, reality-based counseling to other kinky people on the ins and outs of D&S relationships and SM/fetish fantasies.
Sessions must be paid for in full either before or at time of therapy.
$130 for one hour $75 for half an hour
The fee pays for the amount of time I spend working with you. Whether you schedule in-office counseling or we work by telephone, whether counseling is for you alone or you and a partner, the same fee structure applies.
