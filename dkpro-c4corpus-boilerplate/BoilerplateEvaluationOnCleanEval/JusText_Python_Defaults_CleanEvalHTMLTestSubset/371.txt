<h> Trapping Regulations
<p> Definition of Trapping To trap means to take, kill or capture wildlife with traps, deadfalls and other devices commonly used to take wildlife, including the shooting or killing of lawfully trapped animals. It also includes all related activities such as placing, setting, staking or checking traps or assisting another person with these activities.
<p> Required for persons who have never possessed a trapping license. The trapping course is at least 8 hours in length and is free. For information on trapper education courses in your area, contact the nearest DEC regional Sportsman Ed Coordinator.
<p> Possession tags must be filled out immediately after you reach your motor vehicle, camp or home, whichever comes first.
<p> Possession tags must stay with the animal or pelt at all times but they do not need to be attached to the pelt.
<p> Step 2â€” Getting your pelt sealed All Species
<p> A completed furbearer possession tag must be submitted to obtain a plastic pelt seal.
<p> You can give your pelts to another person (other than a taxidermist) so he or she can get the pelts sealed or get them skinned. You must give that person your trapping license or a copy of your license and your completed possession tags while he or she has your pelts.
<p> Beaver
<p> Furbearer possession tags for beaver can be submitted by mail, FAX (518) 402-8925 or in person.
<p> You also may report a beaver using the DECALS call-in system. Call 1-866-GAME-RPT.
<p> Once you have submitted your possession tag(s) for beaver you will be sent or given the plastic pelt seal(s) and instructions.
<p> Immediately upon receipt of seal(s), you must attach the seal(s) to the pelt(s).
<p> Otter, Bobcat, Fisher and Marten
<p> Only authorized Department representatives can attach the plastic pelt seals to otter, bobcat, fisher or marten.
