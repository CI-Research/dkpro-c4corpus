<p> As an optional third step, you may wish to filter packets emerging
from your opportunistic tunnels. These packets arrive on an interface
such as ipsec0, rather than eth0, ppp0
or whatever. For example, in an iptables(8) rule set, you would use:
<p> -i ipsec+
<p> to specify packets arriving on any ipsec device
<p> -o ipsec+
<p> to specify packets leaving via any ipsec device
<p> In this way, you can apply whatever additional filtering you like to
these packets.
<p> The packets emerging on ipsec0 are likely to be things
that a client application on your machine requested: web pages, e-mail,
file transfers and so on. However, any time you initiate an
opportunistic connection, you open a two-way connection to another
machine (or network). It is conceivable that a Bad Guy there could take
advantage of your link.
<p> The basic firewalling for IPsec does not change when you support
incoming connections as well as connections you initiate. You must
still allow IKE (UDP port 500) and ESP (protocol 50) packets to and
from your machine, as in the rules given
above.
<p> However, there is an additional security concern when you allow
incoming opportunistic connections. Incoming opportunistic packets
enter your machine via an IPSec tunnel. That is, they all appear as ESP
(protocol 50) packets, concealing whatever port and protocol
characteristics the packet within the tunnel has. Contained in the
tunnel as they pass through ppp0 or eth0, these
packets can bypass your usual firewall rules on these interfaces.
<p> Consequently, you will want to firewall your ipsec
interfaces the way you would any publicly accessible interface.
<p> A simple way to do this is to create one iptables(8) table with all
your filtering rules for incoming packets, and apply the entire table
to all public interfaces, including ipsec interfaces.
<p> On a gateway, the IPsec-related firewall rules applied for input and
output on the Internet side are exactly as shown
above. A gateway exchanges exactly the same things -- UDP 500
packets and IPsec packets -- with other gateways that a standalone
system does, so it can use exactly the same firewall rules as a
standalone system would.
<p> However, on a gateway there are additional things to do:
<p> you have other interfaces and need rules for them
<p> packets emerging from ipsec processing must be correctly forwarded
<p> You need additional rules to handle these things. For example, adding
some rules to the set shown above we get:
