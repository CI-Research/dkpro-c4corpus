<p> Some tips for fuel-efficient driving:
<p> Ensure your car is tuned and serviced regularly. The worst polluters on our roads tend to be old cars. If you do drive an older car, help the environment by making sure it is tuned according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
<p> Reduce your speed. Driving more slowly reduces fuel consumption. In fact, travelling at 110kph uses up to 25% more fuel than cruising at 90kph. For city driving, 60kph is the most fuel efficient speed.
<p> Drive smoothly. Avoid hard accelerating and heavy braking as it uses up a lot more fuel.
<p> Travel lightly and remove unnecessary items from your car to reduce weight - those golf clubs in the back and the surfboard on the roof create extra load and reduce aerodynamics. This will improve your fuel consumption and reduce emissions.
